# Shopping data

## How to get my shopping data?

S-group: Fill in a form in a customer service desk.

K-group: Fill in a paper and mail it to X.

Both S and K will send you your data in a paper format via mail



## How to analyze my shopping data?

In short, you need to
* Scan your data 
* Use some [Optical character recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (OCR) tool to convert scanned data into a machine readable format. 
* Process and analyse the converted data.

Here's an example workflow that worked for me
* Scan your data into a PDF
* Use [Tesseract](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) for OCR
  * Shell scripts: [S-data](OCR_S-data.sh), K-data (coming)
* Use [R](http://www.r-project.org/) to process and analyze the data
  * [R script]()
